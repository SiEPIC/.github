## SiEPIC GitHub repository highlights:

* [SiEPIC-Tools](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC-Tools): A python package that enables electronic-photonic design automation (EPDA) functions on the free open-source layout editor [KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/).
* [Process Design Kits](https://github.com/SiEPIC/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK): PDKs can be built to work on the SiEPIC EPDA platform. The SiEPIC EBeam PDK is the reference open-source PDK that can be used to design into an EBeam fabrication process.
* [PyOptomip](https://github.com/SiEPIC/pyOptomip): Python package to automate electro-optic testing of silicon photonic probe stations. Reference probe station design is included.
